Today, I'm wearing a Jamdani saree and holding my thesis book, where we've used Artificial Intelligence to revive the ancient form of Jamdani motifs. I've always been insecure about my smile, but since joining MIST, everyone has encouraged me to smile in front of the camera, so I've been gradually learning to do so. Now, you can see a big smile on my face, and people often comment on how happy I look. It's taken me four years to learn to smile like this, and it hasn't been easy. I struggled every day to make it through, often having to put on a brave face when I came home from hall. I've had my fair share of challenges, including losing my temper and struggling with deadlines. I even started treating myself with food whenever I had deadlines, which turned into stress eating. Despite all the difficulties, I made it through MIST, and I believe it was a tough test from Almighty Allah. I'm proud to say that I survived with this big smile on my face. Please pray for me to continue being a good person. Thank you.
